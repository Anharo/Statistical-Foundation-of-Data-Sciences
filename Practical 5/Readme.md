# üéì Teachers Rating Dataset Analysis

## üß≠ Objective
The aim of this practical is to perform **probability and hypothesis testing** using the **Teachers‚Äô Rating Dataset**.  
The practical focuses on calculating probabilities of evaluation scores and conducting a **two-tailed hypothesis test** based on a normal distribution.  
Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **pandas** were used to perform computations.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset named **`ratings`** contains information about **university professors** and their corresponding teaching evaluation ratings.  
It includes demographic details and professional attributes related to the instructors.

| Column | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Prof** | Professor‚Äôs name or unique identifier (duplicates may occur for multiple courses) |
| **Gender** | Gender of the professor (Male/Female) |
| **Tenure** | Indicates whether the professor is tenured (Yes) or untenured (No) |
| **Beauty** | Numerical score representing the perceived beauty of the professor |
| **Rating** | Teaching evaluation score given by students (typically on a 1‚Äì5 scale) |
| **Students** | Number of students who participated in the evaluation |
| **Age** | Age of the professor in years |
| **Division** | Indicates whether the course taught was a lower-division or upper-division course |

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool/Library | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|
| **Python (v3.x)** | Programming environment for analysis |
| **pandas** | Data manipulation and statistical calculations |
| **NumPy** | Numerical operations and probability computations |
| **Matplotlib** | Data visualization and plotting |
| **Google Colab** | Environment for executing code and displaying results |

## üßæ Results Summary

- Computed the **probability** of obtaining an evaluation score greater than 4.5 and between 3.5‚Äì4.2.  
- Performed a **two-tailed Z-test** to determine whether the regional basketball players‚Äô mean score differs from the professional benchmark.  
- Visualized distributions of ratings to interpret probability results effectively.

## üèÅ Conclusion

This practical demonstrated how **probability concepts** and **hypothesis testing** can be applied to real datasets using Python.  
Through this task, i learned how to:
- Compute probabilities from a dataset distribution.  
- Conduct a **two-tailed hypothesis test** using a **Z-test**.  
- Interpret statistical results in the context of real-world performance evaluation.  

Overall, this exercise strengthened understanding of **data analytics, probability theory**, and **inferential statistics** within the Python ecosystem.
