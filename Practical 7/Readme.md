# üéì Teachers Rating Dataset Analysis

## üß≠ Objective
The aim of this practical is to explore **relationships and differences** within the **Teachers‚Äô Rating Dataset** using **regression analysis**, **ANOVA**, and **correlation tests**.  
These experiments help determine how factors such as **gender**, **beauty**, and **age** influence **teaching evaluation scores**.  
Statistical methods are implemented using Python for meaningful interpretation.

## üìä Dataset Description
The dataset named **`ratings`** contains data about **university professors** and their corresponding teaching evaluation ratings.  
It includes demographic and professional details of instructors.

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Prof** | Professor‚Äôs name or unique identifier |
| **Gender** | Gender of the professor (Male/Female) |
| **Tenure** | Indicates whether the professor is tenured (Yes/No) |
| **Beauty** | Numerical score representing the perceived beauty of the professor |
| **Rating** | Teaching evaluation score given by students |
| **Students** | Number of students who rated the professor |
| **Age** | Age of the professor in years |
| **Division** | Course type ‚Äî lower or upper division |

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool/Library | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|
| **Python (v3.x)** | Programming environment |
| **pandas** | Data manipulation and preprocessing |
| **NumPy** | Numerical and statistical computations |
| **statsmodels** | Regression, T-test, and ANOVA analysis |
| **scipy** | Statistical hypothesis testing and correlation |
| **Matplotlib / Seaborn** | Data visualization |
| **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** | Code execution and visualization environment |

## üßæ Results Summary
- **Gender-based regression** revealed if male and female instructors receive different evaluations.  
- **ANOVA** determined if **beauty perceptions** vary significantly by **age**.  
- **Correlation analysis** identified the strength and direction of association between beauty and rating.  

All analyses used **T-tests, F-tests**, and **correlation coefficients** to ensure valid statistical conclusions.

## üèÅ Conclusion
This practical provided hands-on experience in:
- Applying **regression analysis** and interpreting coefficients.  
- Conducting **T-tests** and **ANOVA** for hypothesis testing.  
- Exploring **correlation** between continuous variables.  

The exercise improved understanding of **data-driven hypothesis testing**, **inferential statistics**, and how demographic factors may influence **teaching evaluations**.
