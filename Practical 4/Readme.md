# üéì Student Rating Dataset Analysis

## üß≠ Objective
The aim of this practical is to analyze a **Student Rating Dataset** using Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The task includes performing statistical analysis, data visualization, and interpretation of various factors influencing teaching evaluations ‚Äî including **tenure status**, **age**, **gender**, and **minority representation**.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about **university professors** and their **student evaluation ratings**.  
Each record represents one professor along with demographic and professional details.

| Column | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **prof** | Unique identifier for each professor |
| **age** | Age of the professor in years |
| **gender** | Gender of the professor (Male/Female) |
| **minority** | Indicates whether the professor belongs to a visible minority group (Yes/No) |
| **tenure** | Tenure status of the professor ‚Äî whether they are tenured (Yes) or not (No) |
| **eval** | Evaluation score given by students (typically on a 1‚Äì5 scale) |
| **students** | Number of students who rated the professor |
| **beauty** | Perceived beauty score of the professor (numerical rating) |
| **division** | Course level taught by the professor (Lower or Upper division) |

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool/Library | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|
| **Python (v3.x)** | Core programming language used for analysis |
| **pandas** | Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation |
| **NumPy** | Numerical computations and descriptive statistics |
| **Matplotlib (Pyplot)** | Visualization of data distributions and categorical variables |
| **Seaborn** | Enhanced plotting and styling of graphs |
| **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** | Interactive environment for coding and visualization |

## üßæ Results Summary

- The **percentage of visible minorities with tenure** was calculated and compared with non-minority faculty to analyze representation.  
- **Tenured professors** had a **higher average age** and greater standard deviation, indicating more experience.  
- **Histograms** effectively displayed the age distribution, revealing the spread and central tendency.  
- **Bar charts** were used to illustrate gender ratios using both `bar()` and `barh()`.  
- The **median evaluation score** for tenured professors was computed to summarize their student-rated performance.

## üèÅ Conclusion

This practical provided valuable insights into **data analysis** and **visualization** using Python.  
It demonstrated how demographic and professional variables such as **age**, **tenure**, and **minority status** influence teaching evaluations.  

Through this exercise, i gained experience in:
- Data cleaning and manipulation  
- Descriptive statistical analysis  
- Graphical representation and interpretation of data  

Overall, the practical strengthened the understanding of how to use **Python‚Äôs data analysis ecosystem** for exploring real-world educational datasets.
